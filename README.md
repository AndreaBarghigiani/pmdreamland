## PM Dreamland
My attempt to improve the experience of Project Managers that relies on developers sending a daily report update about their work.

This project has two main part that will benefit teams:
* **for Developers** - show a simple form that (in future) will be pre-populated via their tasks on the application of choice (I am starting with BitBucket because that's what we use internally).
* **for Project Managers** - create a dashboard that gives a simple way to understand how the team work is going.

## Goals
I am creating this project because I want to improve my skills with React and the tools and libraries I am using in the project, the resulting project will be a production-ready app. That a team of developers can easily create and update the progress on tasks that are created on a different platform (generally Jira, Asana or GitHub Issues).

These are the following goals that I want to achieve creating it:
* improve my ability to handle login/logout and relative redirects
* get comfortable with React Query to send query and mutation to db
* start writing tests with Jest, React Testing Library and Cypress

## Working with it
In order to use it you have to create a database, as you can see below I use [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) that has two tables, I list below the column because I have created by Supabase UI and even if simple don't have time to list SQL for it ðŸ˜‰

**tasks:**

* `id` - well, do you want me to explain this? ðŸ˜‚ (HINT it's autogenerated from your database)
* `name` - text 
* `description` - text
* `progress` - number
* `url` - text
* `project` - text
* `created_at` and `edited_at` - timestamp
* `eta` - text
* `status` - text
* `user_id` - relation with `id` column of `user` table
* `completed` - bool
	
**users:**

* `id` - as before
* `email` - text
* `role` - text
* `name` - text
* `surname` - text

I've created this table to have information about logged in user, Supabase stores all the auth information in a private table and I didn't want to make all of them public.

Also keep in mind that the oAuth of the login is handled bia BitBucket so you will need a `KEY` and `URL` keys that you have to store in your `.env.local` file ðŸ˜‰

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

UI build with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com)

Taken inspiration from the [Project-365](https://github.com/MattCSmith/Project-365) I've started journaling in [/notes](/notes).
