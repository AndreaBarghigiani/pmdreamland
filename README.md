## PM Dreamland
My attempt to improve the experience of Project Managers that relies on developers sending a daily report update about their work.

This project has two main part that will benefit teams:
* **for Developers** - show a simple form that (in future) will be pre-populated via their tasks on the application of choice (I am starting with BitBucket because that's what we use internally).
* **for Project Managers** - create a dashboard that gives a simple way to understand how the team work is going.

## Goals
I am creating this project because I want to improve my skills with React and the tools and libraries I am using in the project, the resulting project will be a production-ready app. That a team of developers can easily create and update the progress on tasks that are created on a different platform (generally Jira, Asana or GitHub Issues).

These are the following goals that I want to achieve creating it:
* improve my ability to handle login/logout and relative redirects
* get comfortable with React Query to send query and mutation to db
* start writing tests with Jest, React Testing Library and Cypress
