### Day 1
That's not the real day one of the project but is the first day I decided to start documenting this journey. Today I've implemented a basic Route system that allows the user to move simply by visiting some URL (no fancy redirect based on user role at the moment).
Implemented a basic idea of private routing but still need to improve it to implement redirects in case user is not logged in, this also will protect the app from unfriendly error messages in case some information are missing (watching at you `/tasks`).
