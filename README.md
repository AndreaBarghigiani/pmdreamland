## PM Dreamland
My attempt to improve the experience of Project Managers that relies on developers sending a daily report update about their work.

This project has two main part that will benefit teams:
* **for Developers** - show a simple form that (in future) will be pre-populated via their tasks on the application of choice (I am starting with BitBucket because that's what we use internally).
* **for Project Managers** - create a dashboard that gives a simple way to understand how the team work is going.

#### Credits:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

UI build with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com)
Database and authentication from [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)

Taken inspiration from the [Project-365](https://github.com/MattCSmith/Project-365) I've started journaling in [/notes](/notes).
